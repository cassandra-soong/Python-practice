# The ISBN-10 verification process is used to validate book identification numbers.
# The ISBN-10 format is 9 digits(0 to 9) plus one check character (either a digit or an X). In the case where the check
# character is an X, this represents the value '10'.
# Each digit in the ISBN number is multiplied by 10, 9, 8, ... 1. Its sum is divided by 11 and if the result is 0, then
# the ISBN number is valid.
# For example, ISBN-10 3-598-21508-8 should be (3*10 + 5*9 + 9*8 ... ) mod 11 = 0
