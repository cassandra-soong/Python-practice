# The Luhn algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers 
# such as credit card numbers

# every second digit from the right is doubled
# if the doubled value is greater than 9, then subtract 9 from the product
# sum all digits and if divisible by 10 then the input is valid
